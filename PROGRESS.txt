Ok so I'm trying to give the admin the ability to add and delete users
pretty much buy issuing a http request in the scratch.http file.
The issue is that it doesn't work. I've been testing it out with the 30 local host one
but it doesnt work.

To Fix
-The admin.vue page cannot add or delete users
-There may be files that need the port number updated
-Revamp project to use logging in instead of user drop down (optional)

I think i'm going to focus on users and roles and permissions for my models and ctronllers since i dont have any products in my web app



Need to add the users data to the users.json thing 

need to have exercises access the exercises.json page

supposedly the data gets accessed through the models files and the controller is supposed to use the models files to access the data and do function with it



OK so figured out why the scrtahc http wasnt working. I had the wrong url. 
Still turning everything into exercise instead of user
My plan is to have an exercise databse that the user can search through.
Basically my model view controller will deal with exercises and not user 

Need to get the query to the supabase table to work 

Ok so the get request IS working its returning the index.html as specificed in the dist folder 


Ok so i fixed the delete thing now working in scrtahc and now it delete things from supabase like how it should

What I need to figure out now is how to get the routerlink for the exercise database to work
